# InterLinked Creations

InterLinked Creations is a company that builds a large array of games and tools that make building computer programs easier, all for _free!_ We try to think about what's good for the people, making easy to use tools, secure and family-friendly content for everyone to enjoy. We also like contributing to other people's projects to help others out.

We are mostly big on making Video Games. Most of our games take place in <a href="https://github.com/InterLinked-Creations/Wonder-World">Wonder World</a>, a magical place with many creatures and terrain. 

The Interlinked Creations website and app are still under development, so if you have any ideas you want to pitch in, or see how development is working out, see our <a href="https://github.com/InterLinked-Creations/.github/discussions">GitHub Discussions Page.</a>

This is a start up company, so there aren't very many builds yet.
